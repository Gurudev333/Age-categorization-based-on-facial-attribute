•Goal is to predict age category using facial attributes.</br>
•It includes image preprocessing,series of convolutions, feature maps, pooling.</br>
•It is multi class classification problem in which young, middle, old are the classes.</br>
•Libraries used are keras, sklearn, scipy, numpy, pandas.</br>
•Python is used for the programming and Jupytor Notebook as IDE.
