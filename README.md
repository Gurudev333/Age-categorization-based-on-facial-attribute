# Age-categorization-based-on-facial-Attributes
Shown using</br>
•It is multi class classification problem in which goal is to predict age category using facial attributes with convolutional Neural Network approach.</br>
•It includes tasks data augmentation with resizing, rotation, zooming of images, batch normalization, dropout regularization, feature mapping.</br>
•Libraries used are keras, tensorflow, sklearn, scipy, numpy, pandas.</br>
•Tried different approaches using MLP,CNN, but more accuracy is achived by CNN with data agumentation, batch normalization and dropout regularization.
